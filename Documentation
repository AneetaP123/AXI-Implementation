AMBA AXI

AXI Channels

There are 5 channels in AXI : 
1. Read Address Channel 
2. Write Address Channel
3. Read Data Channel
4. Write Data Channel
5. Write Response Channel

Interface in AXI 
- communciation interface or protocol that define the rule
- specifies how the data transactions are structured
- implemented in various components like processors, memory controllers etc
- Defines signals, timing, read/write transactions, burst transfers, cache coherency etc
- processor, memory controller, peripheral devices
- Ensures proper communication between components
- Influences the communication efficiency at the component level
- Designers need to adhere to AXIprotocol specifications

Interconnect in AXI 
- Physical or logical pathway : responsible for routing data between different components efficiently
- Provides pathways for actual data transfer
- implemented as buses, bridges, crossbars etc
- routes data efficiently between different components
- bus, bridge, crossbar, switch 
- ensures efficient data flow within the SoC
- Influences the overall throughput and latency of the SoC 
- Designers need to optimize for high performance interconnect
